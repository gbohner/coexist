    "We then model the transitions to other testing states, which are largely policy-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the current data (up to 03 April 2020):\n",
    "- only PCR tests have been done in the UK\n",
    "- PCR tests are thought to be carried out almost exclusively on symptomatic patients, to determine if their symptoms are caused by SARS-CoV2 or some other infection (this helps us determine the baseline ILI symptoms in practice, to predict true negative rates of the tests given the SARS-infected vs non-SARS-infected (but ILI symptom producing) populations).\n",
    "\n",
    "One aim of this complete model is to enable policy makers to make decisions now, based on predicted test availability in the future, therefore most testing-related concerns will be hypotheticals. That said, we aim to accurately model the tests' capabilities based on extensive literature research, and also aim to bring stable policy-level outcomes despite the actual numbers may be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important questions answered by integrating this section into the epidemiology model above will be:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. In what ratio we should produce antibody and antigen lateral flow immunoassay tests? They require the same production capabilities and reagents, there is a question ideally suited to the policy making level\n",
